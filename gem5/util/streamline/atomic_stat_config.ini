# Sample stats config file (AtomicSimpleCPU) for m5stats2streamline.py
#
# Stats grouped together will show as grouped in Streamline.
# E.g.,
#
# icache =
#    icache.overall_hits::total
#    icache.overall_misses::total
#
# will display the icache as a stacked line chart.
# Charts will still be configurable in Streamline.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// This object was written to literally mimic a Wire in Ruby, in the sense
// that there is no way for messages to get reordered en route on the WireBuffer.
// With Message Buffers, even if randomization is off and ordered is on,
// messages can arrive in different orders than they were sent because of
// network issues. This mimics a Wire, such that that is not possible. This can
// allow for messages between closely coupled controllers that are not actually
// separated by a network in real systems to simplify coherence.

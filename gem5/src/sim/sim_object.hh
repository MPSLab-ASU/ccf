/**
 * Abstract superclass for simulation objects.  Represents things that
 * correspond to physical components and can be specified via the
 * config file (CPUs, caches, etc.).
 *
 * SimObject initialization is controlled by the instantiate method in
 * src/python/m5/simulate.py. There are slightly different
 * initialization paths when starting the simulation afresh and when
 * loading from a checkpoint.  After instantiation and connecting
 * ports, simulate.py initializes the object using the following call
 * sequence:
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>SimObject::init()
 * <li>SimObject::regStats()
 * <li><ul>
 *     <li>SimObject::initState() if starting afresh.
 *     <li>SimObject::loadState() if restoring from a checkpoint.
 *     </ul>
 * <li>SimObject::resetStats()
 * <li>SimObject::startup()
 * <li>Drainable::drainResume() if resuming from a checkpoint.
 * </ol>
 *
 * @note Whenever a method is called on all objects in the simulator's
 * object tree (e.g., init(), startup(), or loadState()), a pre-order
 * depth-first traversal is performed (see descendants() in
 * SimObject.py). This has the effect of calling the method on the
 * parent node <i>before</i> its children.

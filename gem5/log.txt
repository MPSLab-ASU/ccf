Warning: Your compiler doesn't support incremental linking and lto at the same
         time, so lto is being disabled. To force lto on anyway, use the
         --force-lto option. That will disable partial linking.

*** Summary of Warnings ***
Warning: Your compiler doesn't support incremental linking and lto at the same
         time, so lto is being disabled. To force lto on anyway, use the
         --force-lto option. That will disable partial linking.
Warning: Header file <png.h> not found.
         This host has no libpng library.
         Disabling support for PNG framebuffers.

This directory contains an adaptation of the TSVC test suite that was featured in:
Maleki, S., et al. An Evaluation of Vectorizing Compilers. PACT'11. 10.1109/PACT.2011.68

The original benchmark program has been modified in order to:
 - Make the number of test iterations a command-line parameter.
 - Create versions for different data types (the original benchmark tests only floats)
 - Split out the different kinds of tests
 - Remove the timing information from the output

The original source was retreived from: http://polaris.cs.uiuc.edu/~maleki1/TSVC.tar.gz

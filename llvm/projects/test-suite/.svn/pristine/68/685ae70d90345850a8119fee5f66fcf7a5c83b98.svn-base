This directory contains two separate instances of ALAC (Apple Lossless
Audio Codec). The decode folder tests decoding a CAF file into a WAVE
file and the encode folder tests encoding a WAV file into a CAF file.

The license for ALAC is in each subfolder and has been copied into
this top level folder to make sure that it is clear what the license
is upon a quick glance (no point in not being more verbose than needed).

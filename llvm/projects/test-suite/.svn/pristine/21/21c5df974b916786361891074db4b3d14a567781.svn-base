This directory contains Makefiles and CMakeLists.txt so they can be built and
run as part of the llvm test-suite. The sourcecode and benchmark inputs are of
course not redistributed and have be bought from SPEC.

It is assumed that you have obtained the latest version of the SPEC CPU source,
which is SPEC CPU2000 v1.3 and SPEC CPU2006 v1.2 at the time of this writing.

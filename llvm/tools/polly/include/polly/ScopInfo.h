/// The different memory kinds used in Polly.
///
/// We distinguish between arrays and various scalar memory objects. We use
/// the term ``array'' to describe memory objects that consist of a set of
/// individual data elements arranged in a multi-dimensional grid. A scalar
/// memory object describes an individual data element and is used to model
/// the definition and uses of llvm::Values.
///
/// The polyhedral model does traditionally not reason about SSA values. To
/// reason about llvm::Values we model them "as if" they were zero-dimensional
/// memory objects, even though they were not actually allocated in (main)
/// memory.  Memory for such objects is only alloca[ed] at CodeGeneration
/// time. To relate the memory slots used during code generation with the
/// llvm::Values they belong to the new names for these corresponding stack
/// slots are derived by appending suffixes (currently ".s2a" and ".phiops")
/// to the name of the original llvm::Value. To describe how def/uses are
/// modeled exactly we use these suffixes here as well.
///
/// There are currently four different kinds of memory objects:
enum class MemoryKind {
  /// MemoryKind::Array: Models a one or multi-dimensional array
  ///
  /// A memory object that can be described by a multi-dimensional array.
  /// Memory objects of this type are used to model actual multi-dimensional

  /// other objects:
  ///   - A single data element allocated on the stack using 'alloca' is
  ///     modeled as a one-dimensional, single-element array.
  ///   - A single data element allocated as a global variable is modeled as
  ///     one-dimensional, single-element array.
  ///   - Certain multi-dimensional arrays with variable size, which in
  ///     LLVM-IR are commonly expressed as a single-dimensional access with a
  ///     complicated access function, are modeled as multi-dimensional
  ///     memory objects (grep for "delinearization").

  /// s0 = i (Year of execution)

  /// <A, (i, j, ..)> is executed before a statement instance <B, (i', ..)>, if
